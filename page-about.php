                    <p>Welcome to IMHA, we are so happy you’re here. We are a global 501c3 non-profit that collaborates with local communities to create self-sustaining mental health programs that are built to last.</p>
                    <p>What began as a small project in Bangladesh in 2020 has led us to the global team of passionate mental health advocates we are today. We are grounded in the same belief that we strive to bring to life every day: Everyone’s mental health matters. </p>

                    <div class="row justify-content-between pt-2">
                        <div class="col-lg-7"><p>Our world lacks the education, resources and advocacy needed to bring positive mental health change to our communities. Our mission is to build a healthier world through innovative collaboration. We do this by partnering with communities, leveraging the strengths and passions of their people to create transformative programs that encourage change and growth in mental health for generations to come. </p>
                        <p>What does it mean to innovate together? It means we breathe, speak and work through collaboration. We understand the power of people, of individuality, of coming together to reinvent the conversation. Our mission is more than a statement. It represents the heart and soul of our organization. The reason we get up every day and do what we do. Because of you, because of our communities, because of our will to inspire change together.</p>
                        <p>Help us build a healthier world. Let’s innovate together.</p>

                    It’s a process that transcends borders; <br />
                    Joining forces to work toward a better world for all. <br />
                    It’s staying true to our values while pushing our limits, <br />
                    Supporting one another in our growth, <br />
                    And keeping open minds and open hearts <br />
                    In everything we do. <br />
                    Mental health is not one size fits all. <br />
                    In fact, it is our individualities that give us our strengths. <br />
                    That’s why we’re determined to change the conversation, <br />
                    Establishing a culture where mental health is more than an option: <br />
                    It’s a priority. <br />
                    With the power of unified minds and hearts, anything is possible. <br />
                    We can change the world for the better, one life at a time. <br />
                    But it takes community. <br />
                    It takes all of us. <br />
                    It takes you. <br />
                    So if you’re looking for a way to make a real impact, <br />
                    To inspire change in communities across the globe, <br />
                    And to end the stigma surrounding mental health, <br />
                    Come aboard Team IMHA. <br />
                    We’re so glad you’re here.</p>
